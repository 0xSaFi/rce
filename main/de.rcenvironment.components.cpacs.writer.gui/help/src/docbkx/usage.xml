    <title>CPACS Writer Component Usage</title>
    <sect1>
        <title>Synopsis</title>
    <para>The CPACS Writer component saves incoming CPACS content as an xml file on the local file
            system. It has a runtime-GUI to show the CPACS file in TiGL Viewer.</para>

        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>On the “Target” tab you can select the target folder where the file will be stored. If
            you select the property “Overwrite CPACS file each run” the filename will be “cpacs.xml”
            and the file will be overwritten each time the component runs. If you do not select this
            property a new file will be written on each run with a filename following the scheme
            “cpacs_[iteration count]_[timestamp].xml”.</para>
        <para>You can define the scheduling of the static input channels on the tab “Inputs/Outputs”
            You are also able to add dynamic input or output channels here. Thus it is possible to
            map single values into the XML dataset via XPATH declaration. Moreover, you can select
            single values in order to write them in an output channel.</para>
        <para>On the “Workflow Data” tab you can select whether to store history data for each
            component run or not.</para>

        <title>Runtime GUI</title>
        <para>Double clicking on the CPACS Writer component during or after workflow execution opens
            the “CPACS Geometry” view where the current CPACS content is shown. By clicking the
            button “Show CPACS dataset in TIGL Viewer” the corresponding view “TIGL Viewer” will
            show the CPACS geometry in the TiGL Viewer.</para>
