	<sect2>
	<title>Getting started</title>
		<para>This section describes the required steps to create your first automated GUI test for RCE
			using the RCP testing tools (RCPTT): 
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Download RCPTT for the respective platform from
						http://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/download/</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Please note that you have to use an RCE release or snapshot built after July 2nd 2015.
					For the time being a snapshot can be downloaded here: http://updates-external.sc.dlr.de/rce/6.x/products/standard/snapshots/trunk/zip/</para>
					<para>TODO: Remove this remark once the latest RCE release contains the respective fix.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Check out dev_config.ini file somewhere on your file system. It can be
						found here:
						de.rcenvironment\eclipse\launch\installation_data\dev_config.ini</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Now you can start RCPTT and add RCE as an application under test (AUT).
						Therefore right click somewhere in the "Applications" view at the bottom and
						select "New...". Via "Browse..." you can navigate to RCE's installation
						folder, i.e. the folder that contains the rce executable. When RCPTT
						identifies RCE the name is automatically inserted, but can be replaced by a
						more convenient one. Click "Finish" to complete the dialog.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>To allow RCPTT to start RCE the config.ini has to be set. Therefore right
						click on the application you just added in the "Applications" view and
						select "Configure...". In the following dialog, click "Advanced..." on the
						right hand side. In the just opened window browse to the "Configuration"
						tab. Here in the second group "Configuration File" you can select a
						config.ini that should be used. Select "Use an existing config.ini file as a
						template" and point to the respective location there you checked out the
						dev_config.ini from the RCE repository. Confirm the configuration window
						with "OK".</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>To check out whether RCE can be started, right click on the application
						and select "Run". If RCE starts, you can start to create your own test
						cases</para>
					<para>TODO: Add location where already existent test cases are stored and new
						ones can be added.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>In principle the creation of test cases is the same for every RCP based
						application. Therefore RCPTT's "Getting Started" guide which uses the
						Eclipse IDE as application under test is a good reference. The ideas
						presented here can easily be adapted to RCE's context. You can find it here:
						https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/documentation/userguide/getstarted/</para>
