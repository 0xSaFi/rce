        <para><ulink url="https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/workspacemechanic/">Workspace
                Mechanic</ulink> is an Eclipse plugin that automates common settings in local
            workspaces. For RCE, the most important settings are the Java code formatting rules and
            templates. Other settings are provided for convenience, like disabling the console
            output limit, or showing line numbers in the editor.</para>
        <para>Configuring Workspace Mechanic consists of copying a set of "rule" files to a location
            where the plugin can find them. There are two options for this:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>If you want to apply the rules to all Eclipse installations on your

                        directory; by default, this is <code os="windows"
                                >C:\Users\<replaceable>&lt;user

            Using any SVN tool, check out
                <code>https://svn.sistec.dlr.de/svn/rce/new/meta/eclipse/mechanic</code> into a
            sub-folder called "<code>checkout</code>" within it. (Note that the actual name of the
            sub-folder is not relevant; adapt if you like.) This sub-folder now contains common
            rules on its top level, and optional or experimental rules in sub-folders. Copy all
            common rules to the parent folder (the one you started in), and add any optional rules
            that you want to apply as well. (TODO add and describe batch/shell files for this.)<note>
                <para>These rule files will most likely be integrated into the main project at some
                    point, making this extra checkout step unnecessary. Please note that these rule
                    files are currently not available as part of the <ulink

            </note></para>
        <para>The next time you open a workspace, Workspace Mechanic should pick up these rule files
            and show a notice asking if it should apply them. See the plugin's <ulink

                            <para>The proper way to build completely from source is to compile a
                                local platform repository. This is simply done by navigaring to the
                                    "<code>de.rcenvironment.platform/eclipse</code> folder (from the
                                root of your workspace) and executing the single .launch file that
                                is located there. On the first run, the build process may download
                                quite a few resources from Maven Central; subsequent runs should be
                                fairly quick. Once the build has finished (there should be a
                                "SUCCESS" message near the bottom of the console output), you can
                                build the main product using the .launch files in the "<code>using
                                    local repository builds</code>" sub-folder of the previously
                                mentioned location.</para>

                            <para>Using the .launch files in the "<code>using default remote
                                    repository builds</code>" sub-folder, it is possible to avoid
                                building your own platform repository, and fetch a pre-built one
                                from the main repository servers (currently hosted at DLR) instead.
                                One reason for this can be be to ensure that you are building
                                against the exact same platform repository as some previous RCE
                                release.</para>

                        &lt;...>)</code> .launch file is the best way to produce a standard local
                    product build. The other .launch files are intended for more specific use

                    finished, you will find the .zip files containing the final product in the

                    see it.)</para>
