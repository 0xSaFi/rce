        <para>To run RCE on a system, the only prerequisite is an installed Java Runtime Environment
            (JRE), version 7 or above. If you don't already have one on your machine, <phrase

                it. Starting with RCE 8.x only 64 bit packages of RCE are made available. Therefore,
                please make sure to install the 64 bit version of the JRE.</phrase></para>

        <para os="windows">On Windows, a single zip file is provided to set up client and server

            extract the zip file to a location on your file system.<note>
                <para>IMPORTANT: Please note that due to restrictions of the standard Windows file
                    system (NTFS), you should choose a destination path that is as short as
                    possible. Long paths are known to cause problems, as some RCE files may not be
                    properly extracted from the zip file.</para>
            </note></para>
        <para os="linux">There are two installation options on Linux: installing RCE from .deb/.rpm
            packages, or extracting it from a zip file (which was traditionally used by earlier
            versions of RCE). Whenever possible, using the packages is recommended, as RCE is
            automatically installed into the proper system locations, and can be cleanly managed
            using your distribution's package manager. If you are on a Debian-based distribution, a
            package repository is provided as well, which makes it even easier to install and
            upgrade RCE. The following table compares these options:<table frame="all">

            <para>To register the RCE .deb package repository in your system, you have to add the
                repository location, and add the RCE signing key. Then, you can install RCE like any
                other software package. There are three different ways to do this, all leading to

                install RCE from a .deb or .rpm package, or (equivalently) installing it from the
                APT repository. While installing a daemon from the .zip file distribution can be
                made to work, it creates unnecessary complications regarding installation paths and
                file permissions. As registering a daemon requires root privileges anyway, there
                should be no reason to use the .zip file; if you have a compelling use case for

                daemon life cycle. The only manual step you need to perform before is creating a
                user account that the daemon will run under. For now, this account has to be named
                    <code>rce-daemon</code>; use you distribution's console commands or GUI tools to
                add it. (Please note that this account needs to have a home directory to hold the
                daemon's profile directory.) Future RCE versions will make this account name
                customizable.</para>
