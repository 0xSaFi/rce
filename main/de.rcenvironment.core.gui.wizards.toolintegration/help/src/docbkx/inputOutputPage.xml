        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>On this page, the inputs and outputs for the component are defined. Their behavior is
            the same as other inputs or outputs of other components, but they will always be static.
            That means no user can add or remove inputs or outputs that were defined here. However
            the handling and the constraint options can be customized when the workflow is being
            created. In the wizard you can define which options can be chosen and which one is
            default. It is not mandatory to define inputs and outputs. If there are no inputs, the
            component will run once at workflow start and will be finished then.</para>
        <para>As for the inputs, you can choose the data types File and Directory. If you do so, it
            is possible to define a file or directory name (File/Dir). Thereby the incoming
            file/directory will always be renamed to it.</para>
        <para>If no value is entered, the file/directory will have its original name (noted by “As
            incoming”).</para>
