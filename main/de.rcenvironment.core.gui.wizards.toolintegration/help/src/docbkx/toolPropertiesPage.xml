        <title>Synopsis</title>

            and can be configured when a workflow is set up.</para>

        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>Properties are a means to let the user of the integrated tool configure some
            attributes when creating a workflow. For example, if your tool is able to run with
            multiple cores, you can define a key “numCores” and later add it as placeholder in your
            command execution script or pre/post execution script (e.g. “tool.exe
            ${prop:numCores}”). This key will then be shown in the properties tab in the workflow
            editor and the value for it can be defined there.</para>
        <para>Properties have a display name that makes them more readable for others. Also, a
            default value can be defined, to provide some useful presettings.</para>
        <para>It is not mandatory to define properties.</para>
    </sect1>

        <title>Groups</title>
        <para>With groups you can categorize the properties and group properties for the same
            context. It is also possible to create a file for each group at runtime, which contains
            the keys and the respective values. These files will be located in the “Config” folder
            in a temporary directory with the name that you can also define here.</para>
